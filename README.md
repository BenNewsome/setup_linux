setup_linux
-----------------------
This progamme is designed to install all the programes I like on new instalations of ubuntu or in future other distros.

It adds universal bash aliases.
It installes vim plugins like to use.

It might do other things in the future.

-----------------------------
To-do

* Move to a rsync approach so that I can update settings easier.
* Consider changing from python to bash so I don't need python installed to run.
